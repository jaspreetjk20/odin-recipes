<h3> Description </h3>
<p> Dosas are thin, crispy Indian pancakes made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black gram). Popular in South Indian cuisine, they are usually served with chutneys and sambar. Light, savory, and versatile, dosas can be enjoyed plain or stuffed with fillings like potatoes.</p>   
<h3> Ingredients </h3>
<ul>
<li><strong> Rice</strong> - 1 cup</li>
<li><strong> Urad dal </strong> - 1/4 cup</li>
<li><strong> Fenugreek seeds</strong> - 1/2 teaspoon</li>
<li><strong> Water</strong>- As needed (to make the batter)</li>
<li><strong> Salt </strong>- To taste</li>    
</ul>
<h3> Steps </h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Soak the ingredients:</strong> Wash the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds (if using). Soak them separately in water for about 4-6 hours or overnight.</li>
<li><strong>Grind the batter:</strong> After soaking, drain the water and grind the rice and dal mixture in a blender or wet grinder, adding little water at a time, until you get a smooth, thick batter. The batter should be slightly pourable but not too runny. Transfer the batter to a large bowl.</li>
<li><strong>Ferment the batter:</strong> Cover the bowl and allow the batter to ferment for 8-12 hours (overnight or during the day, depending on the temperature). The batter should rise and become slightly bubbly.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare the dosa:</strong> After fermentation, stir the batter gently. Add salt to taste and a little water if the batter is too thick.</li>
<li><strong>Cook the dosa:</strong> Heat a non-stick or cast-iron skillet on medium heat. Once hot, lightly grease the surface with a cloth or paper towel dipped in oil. Pour a ladleful of batter in the center of the pan and spread it into a thin, circular shape with the back of the ladle.</li>
<li><strong>Crisp the dosa:</strong> Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa. Cook until the edges become golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes. If you like, you can flip the dosa and cook the other side for another minute.</li>
<li><strong>Serve:</strong> Once the dosa is crispy and golden, remove it from the pan and serve hot with chutneys and sambar.</li>
