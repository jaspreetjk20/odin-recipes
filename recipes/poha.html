<h3> Ingredients </h3> 
<ul>
<li> <strong>Flattened rice (poha)</strong> - 1 cup </li>
<li> <strong>Onion </strong> - 1 medium-sized, finely chopped </li>
<li> <strong>Mustard seeds </strong> - 1/2 teaspoon </li>
<li> <strong>Green chilies</strong> - 1-2, finely chopped</li>
<li> <strong>Peanuts</strong> - 2 tablespoons </li>    
</ul>
<h3> Steps </h3>
<ol>
<li> <strong>Rinse the poha:</strong> Wash the poha thoroughly in water to remove any dirt. Drain the water and let it sit for about 5 minutes to soften. Gently fluff it with a fork to separate the flakes.</li>
<li> <strong>Prepare the tempering:</strong> Heat oil in a pan on medium heat. Add mustard seeds, and once they splutter, add curry leaves (if using) and chopped green chilies. Sauté for a few seconds.</li>
<li> <strong>Cook onions and peanuts:</strong> Add the chopped onions to the pan and sauté until they become soft and translucent. Add the peanuts and cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
<li> <strong>Add spices:</strong> Sprinkle turmeric powder and salt to taste. Mix well.</li>
<li> <strong>Combine poha:</strong> Add the rinsed poha to the pan, and gently stir to combine everything evenly. Cook for 2-3 minutes, ensuring that the poha is well-coated with the spices.</li>
<li> <strong>Garnish and serve:</strong> Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and a squeeze of lemon juice. Serve hot with lemon wedges on the side.</li>
