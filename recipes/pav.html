<h3> Description </h3>
<p> Pav Bhaji is a popular street food dish from India, particularly associated with Mumbai but loved all over the country. It's a flavorful and spicy vegetable mash served with buttered and toasted bread rolls, called pav.</p>
<h3> Ingredients </h3>
<ul>
<li> Potatoes - 2 to 3 medium sized, boiled and mashed</li>
<li> Onions - 2 to 3 medium sized, finely chopped</li>
<li> Tomatoes - 2 to 3 medium sized, finely chopped</li>  
<li> Green peas - 1/2 cup </li>
<li> Cauliflower - finely chopped </li>
</ul>
<h3> Steps </h3>
<ol>
<li> <strong>Boil the vegetables:</strong> Peel and chop the potatoes, carrots and cauliflower into small pieces. Cook them in a pressure cooker or a pot with some water until they are soft.</li>
<li> <strong>Heat butter:</strong> In a large pan or a tawa (griddle), heat about 2-3 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.</li>    
<li> <strong>Add vegetables:</strong> Add the boiled and mashed vegetables (potatoes, peas, carrots, bell peppers, and cauliflower) to the pan. Stir well to combine.</li>
<li> <strong>Spices:</strong> Add the pav bhaji masala (1-2 tablespoons), red chili powder (1/2 teaspoon), turmeric powder (1/4 teaspoon), and salt to taste. Stir well to mix the spices evenly with the vegetables.</li>
<li> <strong>Toast the pav:</strong> Slice the pav buns (bread rolls) in half. Heat a tawa or griddle and melt a little butter on it. Place the pav buns on the tawa, cut side down, and toast them until they are golden brown and crispy. You can also toast them with a little more butter for a richer taste.</li>
<li> <strong>Plate the bhaji:</strong> Once the bhaji is ready, transfer it to a serving plate or bowl. Top with extra butter, if desired.</li>
<li> <strong>Serve with pav:</strong> Serve the hot bhaji with the buttered pav on the side. You can also serve the dish with some finely chopped onions, lemon wedges, and coriander leaves on the side for extra flavor.</li>
